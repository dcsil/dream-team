Note: Dreamtune folder consists of all Django settings for the Dreamtune project.
      Dream-app folder consists of all code related to the lead generation app.

Apps exist within projects. This way we can configure multiple apps as we branch out
and add support for mobile etc.

Testing notes:
Add tests to the testing folder. Should be named by "{language}_tests". Add a corresponding entry to GitHub actions IMMEDIATELY.
