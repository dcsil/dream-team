# Diversity in DreamTeam

To us, diversity is at the cornerstone of creative solutions. Within our own team, we have 5 people, spanning 4 countries, 5 musical instruments, and the ability to communicate in 6 languages (and many more programming languages!). We believe our diverse perspectives will help us to create unique solutions which are reflective of our vastly different programs of studies, strengths, interests and upbringings. 

## Strengths & Weaknesses
Our team represents various socioeconomic segments and this gives us a clear view about the representation of the world. Our team is 3 coders strong and features a music and business major giving us a deep understanding of the field as well as how technology can fit into its world. Between us we have at least 37 years of music playing experience spanning 10 instruments giving us an appreciation for what it means to be an artist and why it is important to retrieve the proper royalty payments.

Our team has both interweaving and unique strengths. We possess technical and industry strengths, spanning music industry experience in arts programming to expertise in AI algorithms. Moreover, we each have many transferable, interpersonal strengths including adaptability, creativity, accountability, and leadership. 

Ribhav and Sarthak, two developers from our team, have actually had a startup before which they worked on for a year and secured multiple investment offers. The experience they gained from that experience is invaluable and that has really helped us with the creation of the pitch deck, market research, market analysis, business decision, etc. They also created the MVP for their startup and going through that process was a great learning experience.

Likewise, we each have difference weaknesses that will help each of us to constantly improve ourselves. Explore our personal profiles to find out more! Our biggest weakness is our lack of artists which hinders our ability to create something beautiful. However, as creative individuals we hope to overcome this challenge by following Google Material Design principles and lots of user testing.

### Subject Matter Experts

Subject matter experts who can help us address our expertise gaps are:
- Christine Sutcliffe: UofT Music Student
- Christerra Marketson: A UI/UX expert working for a small consulting firm
- Julian Nadeau: Our amazing TA with lots of industry application coding experience

## Diversity

Our team has a varied background, but we acknowledge that we do not have people experienced in copyright law.

### How this can impact us

Our lack of a specialist in law means our solutions may not release businesses from their complete royalty obligation. We hope to mitigate this by doing thorough research and consulting with SOCAN experts who are knowledgeable in this field to confirm the assumptions we make.

People with experiences that differ from our own can help us in the Music industry because music is one of the most vibrant industries. As a result, it is important that we reflect their population to ensure our solutions line up with the people we hope to help.
