Diversity and Team Background
---

To us, diversity is at the cornerstone of creative solutions. Within our own team, we have 5 people, spanning 4 countries, 5 musical instruments, and the ability to communicate in 6 languages (and many more programming languages!). We believe our diverse perspectives will help us create unique solutions which reflect our vastly different programs of studies, strengths, interests and upbringing. 


## Strengths & Weaknesses

Our team has both interweaving and unique strengths. We possess technical and industry strengths, spanning music industry experience in arts programming to expertise in AI algorithms. Moreover, we each have many transferable, interpersonal strengths including adaptability, creativity, accountability, and leadership. 

Likewise, we have difference weaknesses that will help each of us to constantly improve ourselves. Explore our personal profiles to find out more! 

### Subject Matter Experts

Subject matter experts who can help us address our expertise gaps are:
     - Christine Sutcliffe: UofT Music Student
     - Christerra Marketson: A UI/UX expert working for a small consulting firm
     - Julian Nadeau: Our amazing TA with lots of industry application coding experience

## Diversity

Our team has a varied background, but we acknowledge that we do not have people experienced in copyright law.

### How this can impact us

Our lack of a specialist in law means our solutions may not release businesses from their complete royalty obligation. We hope to mitigate this by doing thorough research and consulting with SOCAN experts who are  knowledgeable in this field to confirm the assumptions we make.

People with experiences that differ from our own can help us in the Music industry because music is one of the most vibrant industries. As a result, it is important that we reflect their population to ensure our solutions line up with the people we hope to help.
