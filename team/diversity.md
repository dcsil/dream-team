Diversity

Diversity is the cornerstone of coming up with creative solutions. With a mix of immigrant, exchange, and Canadian students, our team embraces diversity and believes it will help us put our best foot forward.

Team Background
---

Our team has a varied background. We have 5 people spanning 4 countries and the ability to communicate in 6 different languages! We believe our diverse perspectives help us find unique solutions which reflect our vastly different environments and upbringing. 

## Strengths & Weaknesses

Our team represents various socioeconomic segments and this gives us a clear view about the representation of the world. Our team is 3 coders strong and features a music and business major giving us a deep understanding of the field as well as how technology can fit into its world. Between us we have at least 37 years of music playing experience spanning 10 instruments giving us an appreciation for what it means to be an artist and why it is important to retrieve the proper royalty payments.

Our biggest weakness is our lack of artists which hinders our ability to create something beautiful. However, as creative individuals we hope to overcome this challenge by following Google Material Design principles and lots of user testing.

### Subject Matter Experts

Subject matter experts (SMEs) who can help us address our expertise gaps are:
     - Christine Sutcliffe: UofT Music Student
     - Christerra Marketson: A UI/UX expert working for a small consulting firm
     - Julian Nadeau: Our amazing TA with lots of industry application coding experience
     - Mario Grech: A well established entrepreneur with 4 developed and acquired start-ups
     - Catherine Moore: UofT Faculty of Music. A well established music professor with a grammy winning students.

## Diversity

Our team has a varied background, but we acknowledge that we do not have people experienced in copyright law. We also significantly lack industry experience giving us little insight to how the business world and releases actually work.

### How this can impact us

Our lack of a specialist in law means our solutions may not release businesses from their complete royalty obligation. We hope to mitigate this by doing thorough research and consulting with SOCAN experts who are very knowledgeable in this field. We also acknowledge our worldview is narrow as we are all privileged students and have been living and interacting with a pretty narrow demographic for all our lives impacting our ability to address problems affecting the less privileged.

People with backgrounds that differ from our own can help us in the Music industry because music is one of the most vibrant industries around. As a result it is important that we reflect their population to ensure our solutions line up with the people we hope to help.
